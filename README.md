AutoResearch HPC (`arh`) is a research-protocol layer for **AI-assisted experimentation on infrastructure you already own**. A coding agent can propose and implement an experiment; `arh` makes the boundaries mechanical — claim an iteration, pre-declare it before results exist, execute it through the configured HPC stack, preserve failures, have a model from another family review it, and write the outcome into an append-only record.

It is **not** a scheduler, a workflow engine or an autonomous research daemon. Nextflow executes and caches workflows; Slurm/PBS/local provide compute; Singularity/Apptainer provides pinned task environments. `arh` sits above those and makes the *research process* inspectable.

> [!NOTE]
> **Two layers, one workflow.** **Skills** tell an agent *how to conduct the research task*; the **`arh` CLI** enforces the parts that should not depend on an agent remembering the rules.

## Setup

You need a login node with a scheduler (Slurm, PBS, or neither for local runs) and Apptainer or Singularity. Nothing else — no pre-installed Conda or micromamba, and nothing is written to your shell configuration.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/HudoGriz/autoresearch-hpc.git
export PATH="$PWD/autoresearch-hpc/bin:$PATH"

arh init /shared/my-study --bootstrap   # detect the scheduler, build the pinned Nextflow environment
cd /shared/my-study
arh site detect                         # list your queues and their limits, propose site.md values
arh doctor                              # what is still missing, if anything
```

`arh init` detects Slurm/PBS and the available Singularity/Apptainer command; `--bootstrap` also prepares the pinned host-side Nextflow/Python environment. `arh site detect` fills the gap `arh init` cannot: which queue to use and what it permits. It prints a block for you to paste and never writes `site.md` itself, because choosing a queue depends on cost and who else is waiting. Run inside a project it also checks the existing configuration against the machine, so a queue that does not exist, or more cores or memory than any node in it has, is caught before a job is rejected.

When `arh doctor` prints `Ready`, [run your first iteration](#run-one-declared-experiment).

**Or hand the setup to your coding agent.** Give Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode, Cursor or Copilot this repository and ask:

> Set up AutoResearch HPC for this project. Inspect the repository instructions first, detect my scheduler and container runtime, run the automatic bootstrap, configure the harness integration, then run `arh doctor` and resolve the required setup checks. Do not modify the scientific project or data beyond what AutoResearch HPC setup requires.

The repository ships `AGENTS.md`, reusable skills and harness adapters, so the agent can inspect the machine and follow the repository's own setup path.

<details>
<summary><strong>Air-gapped cluster, or supplying micromamba and the task image yourself</strong></summary>

**You do not need to install micromamba yourself.** Micromamba is a standalone executable. AutoResearch HPC first reuses its own pinned project-local copy, then a matching version already on `PATH`; if neither exists it downloads the pinned binary, verifies its SHA-256 checksum, and caches it under `.arh/tools/micromamba/`. It does not run `micromamba shell init` or modify your shell configuration.

If your HPC cannot reach GitHub, stage a micromamba binary once and provide it explicitly:

```bash
arh init /shared/my-study --bootstrap \
  --micromamba /shared/tools/micromamba
```

To configure the task runtime at the same time, pull its image once and pass it in:

```bash
singularity pull /shared/images/runtime.sif docker://mambaorg/micromamba:2.8.1

arh init /shared/my-study --bootstrap \
  --runtime /shared/images/runtime.sif
```

</details>

Project state lives under `.arh/`:

```text
.arh/config/site.md        scheduler, resources, runtime and shared paths
.arh/config/project.md     immutable inputs and standing project rules
.arh/config/harnesses.md   producer / verifier harnesses and model families
```

> [!TIP]
> `arh` finds the study by walking up from the working directory. Agent harnesses often reset the shell's directory between commands, so `export ARH_PROJECT=/shared/my-study` to make every command resolve the study from anywhere.

## Run one declared experiment

```bash
N=$(arh claim -t "Does the proposed method improve the declared metric?")
arh new -n "$N"

# Complete iterations/iterationN/README.md before any result exists.
arh gate predeclare -n "$N"

arh env create analysis python=3.12 numpy=2.1   # pinned, locked, replayable
arh submit "iterations/iteration${N}/scripts/experiment.nf" -n experiment
arh wait -n "$N"                                # block until submissions and reviews finish

# Write results/report/iterationN_report.md.
arh ask --role adversary -n "$N"
arh gate results -n "$N"
arh ledger render && arh ledger check
```

Or hand the workflow to a configured agent and ask it to **use the Iterate skill** for one research question. The skill describes the procedure; the CLI still supplies the enforcement.

To resume without conversation history:

```bash
arh status
arh next
arh context -n N
```

`PROGRESS.md` inside the study is the authoritative project state. A project should be resumable cold from what is on disk rather than from an old chat transcript.

## The research loop

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    Q["Research question"] --> D["1 · Pre-declare"]
    D --> E["2 · Execute"]
    E --> R["3 · Review & record"]
    R -. "next question" .-> Q
```

| Phase | What happens | Core interface | Durable evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| **1 · Pre-declare** | Claim one question, define the estimand, controls, detection limit and acceptance criteria, then freeze the plan | `arh claim` · `arh new` · `arh gate predeclare` | `CLAIM.json` · `README.md` · `PREDECLARATION.sha256` |
| **2 · Execute** | Run the declared workflow with pinned scientific tooling on the configured compute backend | `arh env` · `arh submit` · `arh run` · `arh wait` | scripts · workflow metadata · run receipts · logs · results |
| **3 · Review & record** | Report the declared quantity, cross-check it, gate the result and update the project record | `arh ask` · `arh gate results` · `arh ledger` | report · cross-check record · review response · `PROGRESS.md` |

Phase 2 runs on infrastructure you already know:

```text
Nextflow controller  →  Slurm / PBS / local  →  Singularity / Apptainer tasks
```

The controller stays on the host so it can see the site's scheduler. Scientific dependencies run in the declared task image; shared paths and site policy live in configuration rather than inside the workflow.

│       └── REVIEW_RESPONSE.md       what was done about each finding
└── verification/                    re-examinations of existing results
```

Failed attempts, nulls, killed controls and superseded conclusions stay visible. A correction becomes a **new iteration**; the old evidence is not rewritten to make the history cleaner.

## Skills and CLI

**Skills are high-level agent playbooks** — how to approach a research action and which checks matter. **`arh` commands are deterministic operations** — they create state, freeze declarations, launch execution, validate gates and maintain the record.

| Skill / workflow | What the agent is being asked to do | Main `arh` machinery underneath |
|---|---|---|
| **[Iterate](skills/iterate/SKILL.md)** | Run one complete research iteration | `claim` → `new` → `gate predeclare` → `submit/run` → `ask` → `gate results` → `ledger` |
| **[Cross-check](skills/cross-check/SKILL.md)** | Critique an iteration from a defined role | `arh ask --role ...` |
| **[Verify](skills/verify/SKILL.md)** | Re-examine an existing result without rewriting history | `arh verify ...` |
| **[Arms](skills/arms/SKILL.md)** | Track parallel sub-analyses with explicit fates | `arh arm ...` |
| **[Replicate](skills/replicate/SKILL.md)** | Reimplement from a frozen specification, blind to the original code | `arh dag ...` · `arh replicate ...` |
| **[Ledger](skills/ledger/SKILL.md)** | Maintain and check the authoritative research record | `arh ledger render/check` |
| **[Ponytail](skills/ponytail/SKILL.md)** | Coding, debugging, refactoring and dependency choices | coding guidance; not a protocol gate |

`harness/install.sh` copies all seven skills into a project. For **Claude Code** they land in `.claude/skills/` and appear as `/iterate`, `/cross-check`, `/verify`, `/arms`, `/replicate`, `/ledger` and `/ponytail`. Codex and OpenCode read the same project contract through their adapters. The portable source of truth remains `skills/` and `AGENTS.md`.

The separation matters: an agent may choose to *use the Iterate skill*, but it is `arh gate predeclare` that refuses a late or altered pre-declaration.

## Beyond the basic loop

The diagram above is a **research loop**, not the discovery DAG. `arh dag` is an advanced feature, used when a load-bearing result needs its actual dependency path reconstructed from inputs to claim.

```bash
arh arm new ...             # parallel sub-analysis inside one iteration
arh verify new OBJECT       # re-examine an existing result
arh dag init -n N           # reconstruct the discovery path
arh dag freeze -n N         # freeze the specification
arh replicate run ...       # blind reimplementation from that frozen DAG
```

The protocol treats disagreement between replicators as useful evidence; agreement is not promoted to scientific confirmation by majority vote.

## Why this layer exists

| Existing component | Keep using it for | AutoResearch HPC adds |
|---|---|---|
| **Nextflow** | scheduling, workflow execution, caching | declared iterations and iteration-owned evidence |
| **Slurm / PBS / local** | compute allocation | a portable execution target rather than a new scheduler |
| **Singularity / Apptainer** | scientific environments | pinned task execution tied to the record |
| **Claude / Codex / OpenCode** | implementation and critique | harness-portable rules, bounded review and explicit model-family provenance |

The framework does **not** treat model agreement as scientific truth. Cross-family critique is evidence to assess, not orthogonal validation. Claims still need whatever independent scientific validation their domain requires.

## Validation and boundaries

AutoResearch HPC is **experimental and pre-1.0**. On 2026-09-17 the suite passed **154 / 154 core protocol checks** and **56 boundary regressions** (55 run, 1 skipped without network) against a configured local site. Earlier runs additionally covered real Slurm success and failure, native cache reuse and an immutable-input container probe.

Internal field deployment exposed review, submission and provenance defects that are now represented by regression tests. The source research material and machine-specific audit record are intentionally not part of this software repository.

```bash
# ARH_TEST_SITE must point at a site.md with runtime_image, runtime_sha256 and
# nextflow_prefix populated — the template in config/ leaves them empty.
export ARH_TEST_SITE=/absolute/path/to/configured/local/site.md
test/run_tests.sh
python3 test/test_hardening.py
bash examples/mean-shift/check.sh
```

The protocol is a cooperative research-integrity system, not a hostile-code sandbox or trusted timestamp authority. Local hashes detect later changes; they do not prove temporal priority against an actor controlling the filesystem. External model services receive the context supplied to them, so local/HPC execution does not imply air-gapped inference.

## Built on existing work

AutoResearch HPC is an independent project. Two upstream sources are vendored, pinned to an upstream commit and recorded with their licences under [`third_party/`](third_party/):

- **[Ponytail](https://github.com/DietrichGebert/ponytail)** (MIT) — the default coding guidance in [`skills/ponytail/`](skills/ponytail/SKILL.md), used unmodified. No upstream hooks, MCP server or auxiliary skills are installed.
- **[ARIS](https://github.com/wanshuiyin/Auto-claude-code-research-in-sleep)** — one review rubric, adapted into the [`adversary` cross-check role](skills/cross-check/roles/adversary.md). The upstream multi-round orchestration is not installed.

It also depends on, rather than reimplements:

- **[Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io/)** — workflow execution, scheduling and caching.
- **[Apptainer / Singularity](https://apptainer.org/)** — pinned task environments.
- **[Slurm](https://slurm.schedmd.com/) / PBS** — compute allocation.
- **[micromamba](https://github.com/mamba-org/mamba)** — the pinned host controller and task environments.
- **[`AGENTS.md`](https://agents.md/)** — the cross-harness agent-instruction convention.

The design borrows pre-registration from clinical trials and psychology's replication reform, and append-only records from lab notebooks and version control; [`docs/related-work.md`](docs/related-work.md) sets out what that means here and which systems this composes with rather than competes against.
