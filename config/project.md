# Project configuration

Everything about **this study**: what is immutable, where the record lives, and
which standing rules every iteration inherits. Site details belong in
`site.md`; this file survives a move between clusters.

## Paths

`immutable_inputs` is a space-separated list of directories that must never be
written to. `arh guard` aborts on any write path outside the project root or
inside one of these, and `arh run` binds each of them read-only.

## Sealed inputs

`sealed_inputs` lists held-out data that only a frozen confirmation may read:
an external validation sample, a test split, a truth set kept for the end.
`arh submit` covers each sealed path with an empty read-only mount, and refuses a
workflow, params file or iteration script that names one, unless the iteration
has a valid `FREEZE.json` (`arh freeze -n N MODEL THRESHOLDS ...`). A run of
such an iteration reads them read-only and appends the read to
`.arh/unseals.tsv`, so every use of the held-out data is on record. `arh run`
never reads them, and `arh guard` refuses writes to them. Do not put an
immutable input inside a sealed one; a sealed path inside a broader immutable
input is covered as well.

## Standing rules

`rules` names files under `rules/` that every iteration inherits. Each rule is a
Markdown file with an `arh-config` block declaring how it is enforced. Rules are
conclusion boundaries — they constrain what an iteration may claim, not what it
may compute.

## Closing the review

`review_response` decides what `arh gate results` does when a review's numbered
findings (`F1:`, `F2:` ...) are not answered in `REVIEW_RESPONSE.md` with a
decision (accepted, rejected, fixed, deferred, disputed): `require` fails the
gate, `warn` reports them, `off` skips the check. Reviews that number no findings
are not checked. `arh gate results -n N --skeleton` prints a response to start
from.

`report_numbers` decides what the gate does with numbers in the report (with a
decimal point or a percent sign) that match no file under `results/` at the
precision written: `warn` lists them, `require` fails, `off` skips. Numbers that
appear in the pre-declaration and the Cross-check section are not checked.

## Pre-declaration

`required_sections` is a comma-separated list of headings an iteration README
must contain before any result may be recorded. `arh gate predeclare` enforces
this, then freezes the file hash; `arh gate results` fails if it changed after
results appeared.

```arh-config
ledger            = PROGRESS.md
