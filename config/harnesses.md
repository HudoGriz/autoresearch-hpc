# Harness configuration

Which agent CLIs are available, how to invoke each non-interactively, and which
model family each belongs to.

The model family matters. A model reviewing its own output can reproduce the
same reasoning errors, so `arh ask` refuses a verification role from the same
configured family unless `--same-family` explicitly records a weaker check.

## Invocation

Each harness declares a command template. `{prompt}` is substituted with the
composed prompt; `{cwd}` with the working directory.

| harness | non-interactive form |
|---|---|
| `claude` | `claude -p "…"` |
| `codex` | `codex exec --skip-git-repo-check "…"` |
| `opencode` | `opencode run "…"` |
| `gemini` | `gemini -p "…"` |

## Roles

`arh ask --role <role>` composes a prompt from
`skills/cross-check/roles/<role>.md`. Shipped roles are `adversary`,
`reimplementer`, `estimand-auditor` and `gotcha-scanner`.

```arh-config
harnesses = claude codex opencode

harness_claude_cmd      = claude -p {prompt}
harness_claude_family   = anthropic
harness_claude_version_cmd = claude --version

harness_codex_cmd       = codex exec --skip-git-repo-check {prompt}
harness_codex_family    = openai
harness_codex_version_cmd = codex --version

# OpenCode routes to several providers, so it has no model family until one is pinned.
# Left as `mixed` it cannot produce or verify an eligible review; pin the model and
# name its family, for example:
#   harness_opencode_cmd    = opencode run -m opencode-go/kimi-k3 {prompt}
#   harness_opencode_family = moonshot
harness_opencode_cmd    = opencode run {prompt}
harness_opencode_family = mixed
harness_opencode_version_cmd = opencode --version

harness_gemini_cmd      = gemini -p {prompt}
harness_gemini_family   = google
harness_gemini_version_cmd = gemini --version

# Who does what. `producer` is the agent that claims and pre-declares; `orchestrator` and
# `executor` split that work when you want one model planning and another implementing, and
# `arh delegate --role executor -n N` hands a bounded task to the named harness. Leave the two
# unset to keep a single agent doing both. `arh delegate list` shows what is configured.
producer     = claude
orchestrator =
executor     =

verifier   = codex
# Whether a cross-check must come from a different model family than the producer. Keep this
# true unless you have a reason: a model does not reliably catch its own reasoning errors, so a
# same-family review is a weaker check. Set it false to accept an adversarial review from the
# producer's own family as a full cross-check -- and record why beside this line. Every review
# stores the value in force when it ran, so changing it later never revalidates or invalidates a
# review already taken.
require_foreign_family = true
# Tried in order only after the verifier refuses the content (arh ask exit 77). Each needs a
# concrete model family other than the producer's, e.g.: verifier_fallback = gemini
verifier_fallback =

ask_timeout = 900
# Delegations fall back to ask_timeout when delegate_timeout is unset.
delegate_timeout =
delegate_max_output_bytes = 262144
ask_max_input_bytes = 24000
ask_max_output_bytes = 8000
ask_output_words = 500
ask_max_rounds = 2
```

## Refusals, fallbacks and token usage

`arh ask` exits 75 when the provider refuses the call on a usage or rate limit, or on
authentication, and prints the provider's own line with any reset time it states. It
exits 77 when the provider refuses the content itself (a safety classifier). Neither
consumes a review round. After a content refusal, each harness in `verifier_fallback`
is tried in turn.

A command template may contain `{usage}`, a file path the command can write a JSON
object of token counts or cost to; `arh ask` stores it in the review record as `usage`.
The framework's `harness/claude/review.sh` and `harness/codex/review.sh` do this. The
prompt stays the first argument, `{usage}` the second, CLI options follow:

    harness_claude_cmd = /path/to/autoresearch-hpc/harness/claude/review.sh {prompt} {usage} --model <model>
    harness_codex_cmd  = /path/to/autoresearch-hpc/harness/codex/review.sh {prompt} {usage} -m <model>

Command templates are parsed as quoted arguments without shell evaluation; use
a wrapper script for pipelines or environment setup. Reviews from `mixed` or
`unknown` families cannot satisfy the required foreign-family gate, and that
applies to the **producer's** family as much as the verifier's — so a router CLI
used as the producer must pin its model too. `arh doctor` and `arh ask` both
refuse such a configuration rather than letting it fail at the results gate. An unchanged
eligible review is reused without a model call. Deterministic execution, status
and context assembly do not call a model.

`harness_<name>_version_cmd` (optional) runs once before each review. Its first
output line is stored in the review record as `verifier_version`, so a verdict
can be traced to the CLI build that produced it. The family alone does not
identify the model. When the provider's default model must not drift between
reviews, pin it in the command template itself (for example
`codex exec -m <model> --skip-git-repo-check {prompt}`).
