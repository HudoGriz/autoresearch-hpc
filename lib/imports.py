"""Code an iteration imports from other iterations: declared, frozen with the plan, checked at submit.

Iterations routinely import a helper from an earlier iteration's scripts/. A run receipt hashed only
the submitting iteration's own scripts, so a pre-declaration that promised "the shared library is
unchanged" could not be checked, and the review found it unchecked (2026-09-29). A plan now declares
its imports in an arh-config block:

    ```arh-config
    imports = iterations/iteration1/scripts/it1_00_lib.py
    ```

`arh gate predeclare` (and `arh verify gate`) append one `import <sha256> <path>` line per file to
PREDECLARATION.sha256, after the plan's own hash and timestamp. `arh submit` refuses a run whose
declared imports changed since, and records them, plus any other iteration's scripts the workflow or
scripts name without declaring them, in the run receipt.

  imports.py freeze ROOT PLAN       print the import lines for a plan being frozen; exit 1 if one is unusable
