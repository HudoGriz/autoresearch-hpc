"""Who is working on an iteration, and when it was last touched (stdlib only).

Two agent sessions on two accounts drove one study. The first stopped at a usage limit with GPU jobs
chained; the second learned the state only from the first one's transcript, and nothing would have
stopped the first from resuming later on the same iteration (field feedback #35). Every arh command
that acts on an iteration now touches its lease: the holder (agent, user, host and ARH_SESSION when
set) and the last activity. Activity by anyone else is allowed but warned about, a takeover is
explicit and recorded, and `arh status` shows each open iteration's holder and how long it has been
idle.

  lease.py touch DIR COMMAND AGENT USER HOST SESSION   record activity; warn when someone else holds it
  lease.py take DIR REASON AGENT USER HOST SESSION     become the holder, keeping the old one in history
  lease.py show DIR                                    holder, since, last activity
  lease.py open ITERATIONS HOURS                       one line per iteration not yet concluded
