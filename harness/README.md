# Harness wiring

One source of truth — `AGENTS.md` at the repo root — is served to each harness
in its own idiomatic form. These files point at the contract rather than
restate it.

Install into a project with:

```bash
./harness/install.sh <project-dir> [harness...]
```

| harness | reads | this directory provides |
|---|---|---|
| Claude Code | `CLAUDE.md`, `.claude/skills/` | symlink to `AGENTS.md`; skills copied in |
| Codex CLI | `AGENTS.md`, `.codex/config.toml` | profile with the protocol approval posture |
| OpenCode | `AGENTS.md`, `opencode.json` | agent definitions per cross-check role; pin a model, or its family stays `mixed` |
| Cursor / Copilot | `AGENTS.md` | nothing extra needed |

For reviews, `claude/review.sh` and `codex/review.sh` wrap the CLIs so `arh ask`
records token usage (`{usage}` in the command template; see `config/harnesses.md`).
Running producer sessions unattended is covered in
[`docs/headless.md`](../docs/headless.md).

Adding a harness means keys in `.arh/config/harnesses.md`
(`harness_<n>_cmd`, `harness_<n>_family`, and the name in `harnesses`) plus any
native config here. Use `arh doctor` to check the configured producer/verifier
families and installed CLIs.

## What has actually been exercised

A shipped entry is not evidence that a harness works. These combinations ran headless, on a
Slurm cluster, through a ten-study replication benchmark in September 2026; the counts are
from its run records. Anything absent from the table ships as configuration only.

| harness | as producer | as verifier |
|---|---|---|
| Claude Code 2.1.270–2.1.278 | Claude Opus 5: 93 rounds; Claude Sonnet 5: 12 rounds | 19 reviews |
| Codex CLI 0.154.0–0.155.0 | GPT-6 Astra, `xhigh` effort: 22 rounds | 15 reviews; 5 content refusals |
| OpenCode 1.14.50 | Kimi K3 (`opencode-go/kimi-k3`): 3 rounds | 1 review with Kimi K3; attempted with a Qwen model, none completed |
| Gemini CLI | not exercised | not exercised |
| Cursor, Copilot | not exercised | not exercised |

A review record stores the verifier's CLI build, not its model, so the verifier column names
no model. Usage limits, not failures, account for most unsuccessful review attempts: 58 for
Codex and 7 for Claude.
